Please note that the PCB of this project is not originally used to make this dialogue robot, the reason I made it just is  i want to clear the inventory!

The MPU6050's peripheral circuits do not need to be welded! ICS-43434 on the board can also be welded without (this thing is too difficult to weld, welding several pieces can not receive the sound), directly use the module better!

Of course, you can also directly open my Lichuang project to modify, export BOM table, I draw a bunch of PCB anyway.
